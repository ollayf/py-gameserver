# YF's python gameserver
This gameserver was created for the unit to be able to have fun playing some old school games.  
Hopefully, w will be able to optimise and expand this gameserver to host many more people to play
this game simultaneously.  
Eventually, we can also get bots in via reinforcement learning to  

## Future Games
- Boxes (already implemented)  
- Chess  
- Fighting Games  
- MOBA  
- Age of War 3  

## Usage
1. Run server.py on the computer you want to serve the games on, taking note of the ipaddr and port  
2. On the computers you want to play this on, run client.py on the computer you want to play on  
3. Contact your local administrator for the gamecode to the particular games  

## Special Thanks
